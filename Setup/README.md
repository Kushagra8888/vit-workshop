# Setup Instructions

## OS requirements
We can use any of Windows, Linux or MacOSX

## Running Ubuntu on Virtual Box
[Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) can be used to run a Ubuntu VM on windows. We will also require
a ubuntu image file which can be downloaded [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/).

## Editor
We will require a text editor for writing our NodeJS programs. There are several options available like VIM, Sublime text,
Notepad++ etc.

However [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) would be preferable

## Setting up MongoDB
*  [For Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
*  [For Ubuntu 64-bit](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

## Setting up NodeJS
*  [For windows](https://nodejs.org/en/#download)
*  [For Ubuntu 64-bit](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)

Once you're done with the setup, you may go to sample-pets folder which will walk through a simple application using NodeJS and MongoDB.
